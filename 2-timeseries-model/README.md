This demo is adapted from [one of the recipes in the Granite Time Series cookbook](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community/granite-timeseries-cookbook/blob/main/recipes/Time_Series/Bike_Sharing_Finetuning_with_Exogenous.ipynb), which provide worked examples for how to apply time series models. 

In the original recipe, a Jupyter notebook shows how to process the dataset from a CSV file, and use this to create a custom fine tuned time series model. 

For this demo project, I've [exported that custom model](./create-model.py) and [made it available](../3-model-api) for use [from Apache Flink](../6-event-processing-flow-details/granite-timeseries-forecast.sql).

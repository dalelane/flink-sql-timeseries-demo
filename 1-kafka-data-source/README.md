The data source for this demo is [a custom simulator](https://github.com/dalelane/kafka-connect-bikesharing-source), which emits randomly generated Kafka events derived from [the dataset](../0-dataset).

Example deployment yaml is included here to show how to use the simulator to create live streams of events using either [IBM Event Streams](./ibm-event-streams) or the [Strimzi Kafka Operator](./strimzi).
